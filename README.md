# Customer Segmentation Project

I have been working in Advertising, specifically Digital Media and Performance, for nearly 3 years and customer behaviour analysis is one of the core concentrations in my day-to-day job. With the help of different analytics platforms (e.g. Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics), my life has been made easier than before since these platforms come with the built-in function of segmentation that analyses user behaviours across dimensions and metrics.

However, despite the convenience provided, I was hoping to leverage Machine Learning to do customer segmentation that can be scalable and applicable to other optimizations in Data Science (e.g. A/B Testing)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is shared publicly via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data).

## Requirements

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* scipy


## Agenda

1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. K-Means Clustering
3. A/B Testing through Hypothesis Testing
